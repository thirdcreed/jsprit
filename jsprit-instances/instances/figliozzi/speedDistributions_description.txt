The depot working time [e, l] is divided into five time periods of equal durations:
[0, 0.2l); [0.2l, 0.4l); [0.4l, 0.6l); [0.6l, 0.8l); and [0.8l, l].

column1	scenario_name (see paper above for scenario descriptions)
column2	speed in [0, 0.2l)
column3 speed in [0.2l, 0.4l)
column4 speed in [0.4l, 0.6l)
column5 speed in [0.6l, 0.8l)
column6 speed in [0.8l, l]

columns seperated by '\t'
speed figures are relative to the speed figures in the original solomon case, i.e. euclidean distance.
